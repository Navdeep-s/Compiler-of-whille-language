# Compiler-of-whille-language
This is a compiler of WHILE langauage using sml-nj 

This was our coding project for programming languages in which we have 
to make a compiler of WHILE language
In this I made it in four steps
- lexical analyser
- parser
- ir generator
- interpreter


A humble request to all that if you have this project as your assignment also don't copy the whole code
Just take the idea and see how you can make an improved version of this
This version is very messy because I complered this in only four days
